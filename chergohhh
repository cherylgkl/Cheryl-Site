        <h2>Why I Picked Up Web Development</h2>
        <p>I am interested in being able to see the fruits of my labour since I will have a tangible result after finishing this course, if I will ever be able to. Most importantly, I didn't want Algorithms.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Actor</h2>
        <p>Leonardo DiCaprio, because he finally has an Oscar award and I admire his perseverance. And also, there's awesome memes of him. Words cannot describe the joy I feel from seeing memes of him.</p>
